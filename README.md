WiseApplier - Auto Job Applier Tool
-----------

This project is an idea I came up with after receiving (insert large number here) negative responses to job applications.
It consists of a script that would crawl the web searching job opportunities that match a user profile (skillset, location/remote opportunity, etc)
and summarize it in a web page. I might add some funcionalities later, like word recognition, so it can do an action automatically or uppon a button click (e.g "email" => Send Email).
By now, this is just an Laravel Application with JWT Authentication.
